-she's been unemployed ever since and continues to agree she should find a job (when she's in a good mood...when she's in a bad mood she takes a job suggestion as an insult) yet she hasn't bothered to even look for any type of job
-she's overweight (probably 300+lbs)
-she hasn't been to the doctor since a little after I was born
-SHE'S EXTREMELY STUBBORN
-my father (married to her and only her for around 28 years now) has a job as a Mechanical Engineer and supports our family of 3 by himself
-I myself have a job at a car wash and I also just graduated high school (with decent grades [A's, B's, C's] and plan to attend college this fall
-my father is an extremely kind person to her and I
-my father does nothing but give give give and she just takes more and more from him


So my mother, to my knowledge, just sits around during the day while I am at school and my father is at work.</POST>

R was nearly a recluse and didn't get along well with large groups of people, especially new people.</TEXT>

It wasn't until everyone took their seats and R sat on the polar opposite side of the table from the guy she arrived with, right next to me, did I get the feeling things were weird between her and the guy, we'll call him T. 

So we're having our game and things go well but T's a total douchbag and I don't care to see that guy again, which is great because he never shows up to another game but as I understand it he still bothers R daily.</POST>

            	<TEXT>I really like you and I want to know what you think of me*" so at that point I was pretty psyched.</TEXT>
            	<POST>

I'll save you guys the awkward year or so where we're not sure what kind of relationship we have and the point where she has a massive panic attack and breaks up with me only to wait 3 months of no communication to talk to me again and ask me to take her back, which of course I do and I'll skip ahead to our starting our second year of living together.</POST>

She still has her problems with being in a relationship and anxiety keeps us from doing all the things that a normal relationship might experience but she's taking baby steps.</POST>

As far as whether or not stories told are real or made up, I'm starting to feel as though I shouldn't bother posting unless I have some proof confirming the story I'm telling really happened, which would be impossible 99% of the time because a) I didn't walk around with a camera in my hand for thirty years while I waited for camera phones to be invented, and b) even if I had, my first instinct in most situations would not be to stop and take a picture in case I told this story twenty years later to someone who demanded proof of it.</POST>

I wouldn't see a doctor for a cold, but when the sinus congestion gets worse after  three or four weeks and starts being so painful that I'm bed-bound and vomitting and then I develop a wet cough that spews greenish gunk out of my lungs every time I try to talk, I know that there's something new going on and off I go.</POST>

This happened to me last year - 10 months of repeated sinus infections coupled with horrible chest congestion, 6 full courses of antibiotics that seemed to improve things only to have it recur a week or two after I finished them (and yes, I finished them, every time), loss of the ability to smell or taste, a referral to an ENT who told me there was nothing wrong with my sinuses and then a referral to a second ENT who confirmed the same, and lots and lots of steroids.</POST>

            	<TEXT>Can't answer for other couples, because I'm not other couples, however for me personally (and my girlfriend too), at this current stage in our lives, bad sex is a deal breaker, that's not to say we have an "off week" and call it quits, that's stupid because I feel everyone goes through peaks and troughs with how good their sex is, but if it was getting to the point where we were only having sex like once a month, and it wasn't that great, and we'd tried to fix the issue and couldn't, then it'd break the deal for me.</TEXT>

So now not sure whether to nip it in the bud-which could make her feel pressured and then cause her to downgrade the relationship even more/end it, or give her more time-which could only make the walls stronger and harder to overcome.</POST>

            	<TEXT>My ex girlfriend and I broke up about 8 months ago after having dated for 4 years because she moved to the Uk for her undergrad degree and it caused a lot of problems.. She messages every now and then to check up and we're supposed to be 'friends' now.</TEXT>
            	<POST>At the end of May I'm going to the uk to visit my family in London and Newcastle, and when she found out I was going she texted me asking whether I could meet up with her when I go.. but I'm honestly not really up for it as I've recently moved on and don't want certain feelings to start flooding back in 

Suggestions on what to do?</POST>

At first we tried hard to keep everything fresh although it was long distance, we skyped weekly, phoned, texted daily...etc , but as time went by things started to fall apart, I got too busy with med school and we stopped phoning / skyping on a regular basis .. so our whole relationship was based purely on texts.</POST>

            	<POST>

Another 2 years past through university until she finally decided to break it off with me because 'I no longer cared' and 'was no longer the person I used to be' ... I guess because I was always the type who wanted to be with someone who I could see a lot in person, I'm pretty 'physical' in showing my affection (but not in a sexual way of course) rather than by all the long term stuff 

So it's been 2 months since we split up, and I'm confused, when people ask me how I feel about the situation I don't even know how to explain myself, it's almost as if it all happened and I just have no feelings towards any of it.. yet I can't imagine myself being with anyone else, I find lots of girls attractive, but I can never bring myself to make an initiative and talk to them and make an effort because I feel like there's no future for me with any of them .. but at the same time I've stopped dreaming about her, in fact I've started dreaming about previous crushes before I even met her ... it's all so confusing 

I'd like your thoughts/analysis?</POST>

            	<POST>Recently she moved to a very nice apartment in the greater NYC area (closer to me) and part of me has begun to wonder if moving in with her could be the solution to my problem.</POST>

He gets mad when I don't do things his way, even when those things have nothing to do with him or he has done nothing to communicate what he wants.</TEXT>
            	<POST>He's told me:

-to quit my deli job for one that pays better
-to go back to school even though I don't know what I want to major in
-that I can't travel (because in his mind the only way to travel is to work an office job for 20 years first)
-I should want to cook for him because I'm a girl
-I'm not as smart as him
-he doesn't want to date me unless it's easy
-I won't be able to get a job if I move to another city
-to just "get over it" when I was depressed
To be fair he's apologized for some of these and he's right about some things, but I hate having to explain myself to him just because I don't want to do things a certain way.</POST>

He gets mad when I don't do things his way, even when those things have nothing to do with him or he has done nothing to communicate what he wants.</PRE>
            	<TEXT>He's told me:

-to quit my deli job for one that pays better
-to go back to school even though I don't know what I want to major in
-that I can't travel (because in his mind the only way to travel is to work an office job for 20 years first)
-I should want to cook for him because I'm a girl
-I'm not as smart as him
-he doesn't want to date me unless it's easy
-I won't be able to get a job if I move to another city
-to just "get over it" when I was depressed
To be fair he's apologized for some of these and he's right about some things, but I hate having to explain myself to him just because I don't want to do things a certain way.</TEXT>
            	<POST>Also, when it comes to telling me to move or get a different job it's easy for him to say because he has his parents' wealth to fall back on every time he makes a life change.</POST>

I went online to alibaba.com and was browsing through and came across some PS4s (in Australia at the moment we can't buy PS4s there Were not enough shipped or some crap so you have to still pre-order and wait a few weeks for next shipment) I was desperate I guess and naive I emailed the company and proceeded to process my order they asked for me to pay buy western union, I insisted that I pay by PayPal but couldn't and I didn't think much of it I asked for receipts ad product orders e.c.t and they sent the information to me.</POST>

-Unmarried women in their 30's are scary

-Managers, or managers with marital problems are even scarier

-Older mothers trying to introduce their daughters are a pain

-Cute interns who don't know any better are ...

-Lawyers, man, I don't even want to go there (I do have one awesome related story though)

-Upper management/bosses above all take the cake :/

-Gay men, which is off topic, is awkward but actually flattering (can be more upfront with them, happened a couple times).</POST>

            	<TEXT>Who knows, bad luck, but they're not from around here..)

Right after that the doctors had me checked in for surgery prep, I had to wait close to 2 hours since there were other folks ahead of me for "other" ailments (mostly IV drug users who regularly develop cysts from shooting up).</TEXT>
            	<POST>By the time I was finally moved to the surgery room (less than 20 hours after when my ass felt sore) the cyst had already grown to about the size of a baseball.</POST>

So the doctors prescribed both of us some HEAVY duty antibiotics this time, so strong you become lethargic with very little energy to do anything (and your pee becomes the color of orange Tang), neither of us could barely stay awake for 3 weeks until the prescription ran out.</POST>

However there is a very small minority that may not know English, they probably grew up in the sticks (Barrio) and were too poor to afford school (and didn't even have a TV).</POST>

            	<TEXT>And marriage scared me too and I was not even sure about her because I feel like maybe she was not "good enough" but she was amazing.</TEXT>
            	<POST>I feel like alot of it had to do with the uncertainty and I had no idea what the future held and I actually asked my parents on multiple occasions for them to look at her- just to see if they liked her and if we could maybe get engaged.</POST>

            	<TEXT>We spok e about the incident entirely and she's willing to do anything I ask to fix the trust issues, such as temporarily deleting all of her social media profiles while we rebuild our relationship, she let me delete and block anyone I didn't like from her phone and she's been being honest about everything Ive asked.</TEXT>
            	<POST>Shes even ok with the thought of me fucking another girl because I told her that the only way I would feel better about the situation ( I don't want her to feel the pain ive felt so I will not actually fuck anyone else) she wasn't happy about it but she's fine with it.</POST>

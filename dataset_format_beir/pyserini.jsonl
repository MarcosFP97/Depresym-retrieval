The 4 of us finished our fifths and we spent the rest of the night drinking whatever was handed to us.. I don't even remember midnight but I do remember not knowing where one of my friends was, so I went downstairs to find him and he was passed out on a bean bag, since I found this hilarious I took a quick picture of him.. When I looked at the picture I just took I noticed his face was covered in blood.. So we got a couple sober friends to drive him to the hospital where he ended up having to get something like 12 stitches in his forehead and resuscitated 3 times.. After my buddy left I don't remember anything and woke up on the floor in my own bedroom.. I learned later that day that I was being a drunk asshole and wouldn't let my other friend drive me home because I didn't want to leave my car, and since he couldn't drive a stick I worked the gas/brake/clutch and shifter while he steered.. Once we got home I drank more with my family and ended up puking a couple of times..  Also I was on my floor because my friend says when he tried to move me to my bed I told him everytime he touched me he \"rocked the boat\" definitely not the most responsible night of my life... But at least I have the story... \n\n\nAlso, my friend who went to the hospital ended up being okay, he was laughing about it the next day and kinda became a legend at school...\n\nSenior year was fun\n\n\nTL;DR Drank too much, friend died a couple of times, and we tag-team drunk drove our irresponsible asses home"}

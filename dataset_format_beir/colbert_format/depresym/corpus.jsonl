I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)\n\nRest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... \n\nSo, that's about it :)\n\nThank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming..", "title": ""}

So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. \n\nSo, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)\n\nAnd coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)\n\nRest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... \n\nSo, that's about it :)\n\nThank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming..", "title": ""}

But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I did not beg infront of her to hear me out cuz I knew I was not wrong back then.... So I never told her what happened.... And maybe that's on me .... This was in 2019..... It's been like 2 years and still she doesn't even know anything about this so it's like I was the bad person for the failure of that relationship and nor do my friends know about it... I am scared that if I tell them then they will just joke about it and make fun of me so I never told them about it.... And yeah.... I don't want her sympathy or anything but I just want her to know that I was not the bad person in this situation... So yup it's been 2 years and now I am going to get admitted into an iit (most prestigious Indian colleges) ... I am happy about that but also sad about this shit.... I wish I could clear this someday... I want to clear this so fucking badly that even if she send a simple hey to me...I swear I ill clear everything but idk how to tell her now...", "title": ""}

{"_id": "s_2425_151_0", "text": "Once I had gone on a date (my one and only dat till date) in my 11th STD.... It went pretty well... I liked her she liked me.... But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I am not that \"please ek baar toh meri baat sun lo!!", "title": ""}

{"_id": "s_2425_173_0", "text": "Once I had gone on a date (my one and only dat till date) in my 11th STD.... It went pretty well... I liked her she liked me.... But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I did not beg infront of her to hear me out cuz I knew I was not wrong back then.... So I never told her what happened.... And maybe that's on me .... This was in 2019..... It's been like 2 years and still she doesn't even know anything about this so it's like I was the bad person for the failure of that relationship and nor do my friends know about it... I am scared that if I tell them then they will just joke about it and make fun of me so I never told them about it.... And yeah.... I don't want her sympathy or anything but I just want her to know that I was not the bad person in this situation... So yup it's been 2 years and now I am going to get admitted into an iit (most prestigious Indian colleges) ... I am happy about that but also sad about this shit.... I wish I could clear this someday... I want to clear this so fucking badly that even if she send a simple hey to me...I swear I ill clear everything but idk how to tell her now...", "title": ""}

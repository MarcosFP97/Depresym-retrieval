s_3003_432_0	I've been feeling really down lately, and I have the feeling that isn't going to just go away on its own if I don't do something...  There are many reasons why I'm feeling like this, TTC being part of it (I think it's just excerbated things that were already there).
s_1050_1190_1	i hate to cry about it but its true
s_697_43_4	But I can relate to the sadness and lack of motivation.

s_1959_494_0	I'm sure that symbolizes loneliness.
s_2959_891_0	The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books..   So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)  And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)  Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally...   So, that's about it :)  Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming..

s_1269_897_2	It makes sense that they're worse when you're already anxious.
s_1271_299_2	Feeling hopeless can lead you down the path of depression, something I've experienced a lot of and something that helped keep me going was a hope that someday my life could be better, that I could enjoy it again, even though I couldn't see how that could happen from where I was.

s_891_1158_82	Nothing Will Ever Get Better!
s_1808_30_1	my friend pointed this out to me the other day, and he's right, I am always comparing my life to others and it is always making me miserable and ruining my goals  for some reason, I always see myself as inferior to other people when I compare myself or others, or my life seems less fun and exciting when comparing it to other peoples  it makes it feel like I need to play catch up with other people in life.
s_439_72_12	I'm sure that dating someone else right now would be a bad idea anyway but I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects.
s_1495_649_3	I somehow can handle it so far but feel completely hopeless most of time.

s_8_217_5	The worst part about it is with nothing to enjoy at all I can only focus on bad things and so my suicidal depression is here at the moment and I feel like there's no reason to live my life.
s_3010_32_3	And assuming my past self is much younger than I am and my future self is much older, present me would be much more receptive to life advice.
s_2117_406_4	The decisions you make for yourself today will change your future - so what decision do you need to make today to ensure Future You has the life she deserves?

s_2689_714_2	/u/FoleyX90, don't be discouraged from suggesting anime.
s_567_18_15	But behind every tired and worn clich there exists a kernel of truth, a source of the exhaustion, and I can attest to the fact.
s_839_613_15	But I feel my lack of interest in the project will end up hurting the final product.
s_2402_17_2	Yeah, so everything's getting way worse,  mood swings and lack of motivation,  extreme overreaction,  fear of abandoned by my boyfriend is getting worse ect. ..
s_2144_1341_2	I see great prospects for the future.

s_221_1200_1	I think his supporters pre-maturely declaring defeat for him was a very big hurdle, and I think he's pretty much overcome it.
s_1226_774_1	But its still worrying.
s_912_119_0	It's really about the money to dice, which is why a lot of your concerns will likely never be addressed and even get worse to you in future battlefields.

s_1648_112_0	What we should really have been worried about
s_2273_680_1	If you have too little optimism, youll always feel like youll fail before you do something.
s_508_64_7	It is impossible to live with something like this, I cannot pursue my dreams when I am depressed and in anhedonia.
s_2958_6_17	I should be writing music, I should take account of myself more, I should just *feel* more, I shouldn't be as skinny as I am, I should be writing more articles as a journalist and getting my name out there, but I can't and I don't know whats wrong with me.
s_1492_402_0	I've got no prospects in life FTFY

s_2625_14_3	I really just had to lower my expectations or try to find something positive about the experience.
s_2978_7_1	But also, my pessimism is more bandwagoning than anything.
s_3042_13_7	I know things will get better, I just have to break the cycle I'm in.
s_2273_522_1	Maybe its because while my life isnt the best Im still content with what I have and knowing that death will mean that its a blank space of nothing and that my life will be gone scares me.
s_2402_1043_2	I've had it with College, my work experience and my whole life.
s_1551_0_0	Feeling guilty, regretful, and ashamed over what feels like a wasted 5 years
s_1756_1027_2	To me it's more just fat acceptance which shouldn't be something you shame people for but it shouldn't be encouraged either.
s_761_350_1	Quote:   Needing to talk badly about others indicates low self-esteem.
s_1527_611_1	The US continually makes me angry and it's only getting worse.
s_2006_107_6	I have great friends, a beautiful family, and I'm still hopeless.
s_2065_451_0	Tbh I was slightly concerned but I guess I'll worry about it more when/if it..uhhh...comes out the other end?

s_2815_1307_104	I worried you might be confused, but you always surprised me by your maturity.
s_2584_13_7	depression, anxiety, and loneliness is going to kill me.
s_1681_566_1	Pretty much no expectations, other than it would be good.
s_1025_209_0	Its just a mix of melancholy,sadness,happiness,guilt and nostalgia
s_29_1167_0	Don't get me wrong, that sounds shitty, but anxiety and phobias can be a bitch.

s_2701_963_0	My pessimism was driven by market, competition, costs, profits.
s_1764_49_5	If something doesn't work out, it's not meant to be.

s_2690_613_2	Now I am not really worried.
s_8_52_3	Whenever my outlook is better all that remains is still utter lack of emotions; can't feel pleasure or joy in anything, and this always eventually leads back to dark thoughts.
s_2993_393_2	That's why getting off drugs seem like it's never going to happen but I know I can't live like this, I was just barely living before the drugs.

s_1100_209_1	One type of depression involves numbness rather than any specific negative feelings.

s_2500_878_2	And scared for our future.
s_996_489_0	I like being optimistic.
s_1635_108_17	To listen without patience, acceptance, and an honest open mind, results in a tenacity and stubborn resistance to change, with an unwillingness to acknowledge defeat not only to the speaker, but to yourself.

s_356_94_5	I feel so empty.

s_911_432_0	the problem with uncletopia is that it tries to be casual but with the way community servers work its hard to do that its always going to be one or two servers that are completely full, and every other server is dead (good luck if the non-dead servers aren't in your region) and with how more often than not many people leave the server after a round completion, you have to end up trying to grt into a different server which is usually already full yet again, repeating the process of trying to get into an already full server not to mention that its very difficult to find a match thats just beginning or is in setup im not saying uncletopia is to blame for much of this as many people dont play community servers so its hard to have many people in a lot of your servers, but at the same time they really should figure out a way to make a queue system like casual tf2 has my personal suggestion is to make a website that has a queue button and it will put you into the closest and non full server (just like casual, so you dont have to try and get lucky enough to get a spot in an already started match) this would mean that the servers wouldnt be able to be joined via the community server search but it solves the issue of 2 servers being full and all the others being empty (this would probably also increase uncletopia's player count as i can imagine that there are more people like me that also have this issue with uncletopia) i really like uncletopia but its just has this one major problem that's inherently in all community servers due to community servers not being matchmaking, but uncletopia has this issue more than every other server

s_2425_173_0	Once I had gone on a date (my one and only dat till date) in my 11th STD.... It went pretty well... I liked her she liked me.... But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I did not beg infront of her to hear me out cuz I knew I was not wrong back then.... So I never told her what happened.... And maybe that's on me .... This was in 2019..... It's been like 2 years and still she doesn't even know anything about this so it's like I was the bad person for the failure of that relationship and nor do my friends know about it... I am scared that if I tell them then they will just joke about it and make fun of me so I never told them about it.... And yeah.... I don't want her sympathy or anything but I just want her to know that I was not the bad person in this situation... So yup it's been 2 years and now I am going to get admitted into an iit (most prestigious Indian colleges) ... I am happy about that but also sad about this shit.... I wish I could clear this someday... I want to clear this so fucking badly that even if she send a simple hey to me...I swear I ill clear everything but idk how to tell her now...

Yes.. I'm not being serious when I say I look down upon them.. I know so many damn interesting people who don't read but are fucikn interesting at their minds...

Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I am not that ""please ek baar toh meri baat sun lo!!"

s_2518_2_0	I don't really worry too much and don't have anything to worry about.

s_1307_1_1	Well going on the new Star Wars film coming out soon, it's really refreshing seeing them go back to its roots  I wish it would become the way forward for all studios now to see the benefits of real sets and practical effects  I think bad practical effects can stick out like a white elephant but at least practical models and effects will always age well whereas bad CGI never ages well and looks bland after a few years  In decades time you will always believe another world in older films because it is all real, nothing was faked whereas older CGI oriented films will look ropey as hell and because it was largely faked and made up, nothing is real to believe  I would say look at Jaws as a prime example, they had 3 model sharks that hardly ever worked but the film was a masterpiece, instead of having the shark as the focus, it had great characters and put suspense and that music to full effect meaning what you didn't see was far more unnerving  CGI in 3D looks ridiculous no matter how much money they throw at it, it will always look fake, then there is IMAX, I wish this format was the standard in films nowadays, all films should fill the frame and be as real and clear as possible, Nolan's Batman films are a shining example of it being used correctly

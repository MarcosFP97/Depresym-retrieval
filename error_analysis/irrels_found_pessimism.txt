My biggest fear is being even more miserable and helpless than I have been the last few years of my youth.
How will I build a better future for myself then?
Ive been feeling this way for the past week and I dont know what to do I dont feel suicidal or anything but I am feeling a sense of hopelessness so maybe Ill turn here to Reddit.
I am extremely confused by the current obstacles in my life.
I don't know what to do with life and feel like I should've felt this way back in high school.
Right now I have trouble seeing a future at all.
I am about to fail an apprenticeship, 2015 has been the worst year of my life.
Currently I dont know what to do with my life.
I'm worried about the future of my Country, and I can't help but feel that Life is only gonna get harder.

I feel like it's my last step towards feeling good about my future.
I have no future goals or dreams, not even one plan for next week (beside seeing my therapist again).
It can feel like things are just getting worse and worse and that there is neither hope for ourselves or the countries we live in.
I am trying not fall into a pit of depression,anxiety and fear of the future again.
I fear for the future
I'm slowly accepting the emptiness of my future, but I don't want to go through an existence of just.
I feel so hopeless and helpless most days, loneliness and constantly comparing myself to others doesnt help.
I feel like Im stuck in a never ending spiral.
Now Im not only worrying about myself and my future but a made up characters future!
This perpetual fear is making me have suicidal thoughts (don't worry, I'm not going to do it no matter how much I wish to), I just don't want to face my future.
I feel like I'm not in control of my life at all anymore and I just can't deal with the constant guilt about the opportunities I'm wasting.
That I'll waste away my life doing nothing fulfilling or anything that makes me happy and I'll end up all alone and sad.
There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains
I actually dropped out this semester and the anxiety I get about future is horrible.
I have great friends, a beautiful family, and I'm still hopeless.
I'm afraid I will lose my youth because of depression.
I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling.
I hope this shit gets better but sometimes having hope feels hopeless.
I am very pessimistic, get anxious and feel like I have to depend on others for everything.
I see no future.
There is nothing I enjoy in life, and the things I might enjoy are impossibl to achieve.

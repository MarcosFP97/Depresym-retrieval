I hated myself in that moment.
I love myself too much to disrespect myself in such a way.
I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore.
I am my own worst enemy.
I've lost faith in myself.
I just don't have the courage or the confidence to, and it makes me hate myself
How do I love myself when I am not good enough for myself?
I feel alone because I'm not happy with myself.
I've lost all sense of self-confidence and I hate my body.
I realized recently that I don't have to dislike myself just because I don't look the way I'd like to look... That is okay to like a body that's flawed.
Oh well fuck it I hate myself.
I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself.
I have become almost ashamed of everything I am.
I feel inferior and hate myself for it.
I dislike the way i push everyone away and i hste that i isolate myself.
Well Im falling behind in college and I hate myself right now
My self esteem went down and I was feel as if people just don't like me now.
I cant bring myself to do anything and I fucking hate myself for it
No matter how good I felt about other things, if I saw myself in a mirror, I was miserable.
I hate myself, I think I'm horrible at everything, and the world would be a better place without me but people are constantly telling me how confident I am.
I look at myself in reality and am disappointed with the person I have become.

Today I just feel sad and disappointed.
I don't like being that sad.
Its not dread.....i domt feel anything i dont feel any emotion right now and that feeling is worse then being sad i feel dead from head to toe i just frel desd
But I'm feeling sad, angry, and just plain flat.
I don't feel profoundly sad all the time... well, maybe deep inside, but on the surface I am very able of laughing and experiencing transient happiness.
This happens pretty much any time I feel down but I try to do things anyway.
I feel generally ashamed of myself, and sad about my life and the way Im living it.
I feel depressed at the moment.
i am really unhappy.
Everyday for the last going on if not two months I have been depressed
i have depression.
I'm a rather depressed person.
I tell myself that me being sad wont make the world less horrible, so why not choose to be happy?
I like feeling sad.
I feel bad and sad everyday 5.
I'm tired of feeling so down, but yet I do nothing to heal.
Depression and anxiety like to trick you, it's like every single second I feel sad I think "you're not actually sad, you're fooling everyone and yourself" etc etc, not in those words tho.
I've been feeling depressed for the majority of my life and right now, I feel like everyone would be better off and happier if I wasn't in their life at all.
I am sad and I don't know why :(
I'm not really into being sad.

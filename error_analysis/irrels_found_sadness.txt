I'm just so blah all the time.
I feel like I should be miserable, like I should be crying or upset in any way.
I don't feel depressed, just lonely.
I just thought I was a sad person in general, since Id known the feeling for so long.
Apathy, numbness and just the sad zombie mood in which I'm miserably sad but can't vent it out is just awful.
I dont know what its like to be sad but not wanting to die because of that sadness.
The thing is that this sadness just rests during the day, as if I'm ignoring it, but at some point it bursts out quickly and all at once.
I feel some sadness but its not like full on severe depression.
